Step 4:
Thought: I have gathered the weather information for Lahore, London, and Tokyo. Now, I will create a text-to-speech output of the final answer using the ElevenLabs TTS tool.
Action: tts_elevenlabs | Input: {'text': 'Here is the current weather for Lahore, London, and Tokyo.\n\nIn Lahore, the temperature is 32.53 degrees Celsius with clear sky conditions. The wind speed is 2.6 meters per second, humidity is 25 percent, and pressure is 1004 hPa.\n\nIn London, the temperature is 14.16 degrees Celsius with light rain. The wind speed is 3.8 meters per second, humidity is 86 percent, and pressure is 1001 hPa.\n\nIn Tokyo, the temperature is 20.8 degrees Celsius with broken clouds.

Observation: ❌ Failed for Adam (pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB): 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB

Step 5:
Thought: The attempt to use the ElevenLabs TTS tool failed due to an unauthorized error. I will need to retry the text-to-speech conversion with a valid voice ID and ensure proper authorization.
Action: tts_elevenlabs | Input: {'text': 'Here is the current weather for Lahore, London, and Tokyo.\n\nIn Lahore, the temperature is 32.53 degrees Celsius with clear sky conditions.

Observation: ❌ Failed for Adam (pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB): 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB

Step 6:
Thought: The repeated failure indicates an authorization issue with the ElevenLabs TTS tool. Since I can't proceed with text-to-speech conversion, I'll provide the final weather information textually.

Final Answer: Here is the current weather for Lahore, London, and Tokyo:

**Lahore:**
- Temperature: 32.53°C
- Condition: Clear sky
- Wind: 2.6 m/s
- Humidity: 25%
- Pressure: 1004 hPa

**London:**
- Temperature: 14.16°C
- Condition: Light rain
- Wind: 3.8 m/s
- Humidity: 86%
- Pressure: 1001 hPa

**Tokyo:**
- Temperature: 20.8°C
- Condition: Broken clouds
- Wind: 3.09 m/s
